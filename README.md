#WIP!

The Federation is a group of open source projects that have agreed to play by some common rules.  

One federated project can always depend on another without introducing diamond dependency issues.  

The Federation makes it possible for the client to consume/depend upon all federated projects with a 
guarantee that the components have been tested and verified to work together
